- **Authentication**: Securely sign in to personalize your interactions.
- **Save History**: Save your favorite recipes or interactions for later reference (currently in development).

## Future Plans

- **About Me Page**: We're planning to add an "About Me" page to make it easier to navigate and understand how to use GourmetGuide.
- **Enhanced Application Integration**: We aim to integrate GourmetGuide with a more complex application, providing you with even more options for cooking and meal planning.
- **Real-Time Location Access**: Future updates will allow GourmetGuide to suggest nearby restaurants and other places to eat, offering expanded options for dining in or eating out.
